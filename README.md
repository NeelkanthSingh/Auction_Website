What does this project do? and What is it's purpose?


It is my personal project, it gives people platform to buy and sell other's/thier's belongings, whatever they deem fit.

Sellers can give a base price in the post to thier item's along with minimum rasing price.

Buyers can compete among themselves and raise price to out do the other.

After a day of posting, the last bidder shall be mailed the "seller's mail", similarly the Seller shall be mailed last "bidder's mail" and the post will be removed.

As of now the seller and buyer can further settle outside of the platform at thier convinience.

Only a minimum of 1RS and that also only once, is needed to post any number item on the platform.
